OboApp helps residents stay informed about public infrastructure disruptions. It collects announcements about water shutoffs, heating maintenance, road repairs, municipal works, and similar incidents; turns them into structured geospatial events; and serves them through a PWA map, push notifications, and a public API.

Built for Sofia first, OboApp is designed so other cities can fork the platform, configure their own local sources, and operate an independent civic information service.

## What You Can Build With It

- A public map of active infrastructure disruptions
- Push notifications for user-defined areas
- A city-specific ingest pipeline for public notices
- A read-only public disruption API
- A local civic data platform backed by Firebase, MongoDB, and geospatial enrichment

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	sources[Public sources] --> crawlers[Crawlers]
	crawlers --> ingest[AI filtering and extraction]
	ingest --> geocoding[Multi-provider geocoding]
	geocoding --> events[Messages and events]
	events --> web[PWA map]
	events --> api[Public API]
	events --> notifications[Push notifications]
```

Automated crawlers collect notices from public sources such as utility providers, heating companies, transport operators, and municipal sites. AI-powered filtering, categorization, location extraction, and multi-service geocoding convert raw text into map-ready GeoJSON. Event matching groups related disruptions, and the notification engine matches new events with user-defined interest areas.

The web app is a Next.js Progressive Web App with an interactive map. Users can browse current disruptions, define interest circles with a custom radius, and receive notifications when new issues affect their areas.

## Quick Start

Choose the setup path that matches what you want to work on:

This is a pnpm workspace monorepo. Always install dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

The shared packages build automatically during `postinstall`.

If you modify shared schemas or database types, rebuild before running `web/`, `ingest/`, or `api/` code:

```bash
pnpm build:shared
pnpm build:db
```

## Contribution Areas

OboApp has several independent surfaces for contributors. Each area links to open issues where that kind of work is needed.

## Quality Bar

Before opening a PR, run the checks that match the packages you changed. The broad workspace checks are:

```bash
pnpm build:all
pnpm lint:all
pnpm test:all
```

For TypeScript validation, run `pnpm tsc --noEmit` in the affected package, especially [ingest/](ingest), [web/](web), and [api/](api).

Important project rules:

- Database operations go through `@oboapp/db`; application code should not call Firestore directly.
- Shared schema changes require rebuilding [shared/](shared) and [db/](db) before running dependent packages.
- New crawlers should update the crawler implementation, Terraform crawler list, source definition, and source assembly together.
- Web UI text is Bulgarian in informal register.
- Documentation is concise, behavior-focused, and written for technical stakeholders, operators, and QA personnel.

Additional implementation standards live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
