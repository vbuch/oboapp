# Locality Configuration

## Overview

The project supports hosting data for a single configurable locality through the `locality` field and environment-based configuration.

## Architecture

### Locality Field

- **Format:** `{country}.{locality}` (e.g., `bg.sofia` for Sofia, Bulgaria)
- **Storage:** Added to both `sources` and `messages` collections in Firestore
- **Required:** All crawlers must specify a locality

### Environment Configuration

Required environment variables (no defaults):

**Backend/Ingest:**
```bash
LOCALITY=bg.sofia
```

**Frontend/Web:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCALITY=bg.sofia
```

### Bounds Registry

Bounds are stored in the shared package (`@oboapp/shared`):

```typescript
export const BOUNDS: Record<string, BoundsDefinition> = {
  "bg.sofia": { south: 42.605, west: 23.188, north: 42.83, east: 23.528 },
  // Add new localities here
};
```

### GeoJSON Files

Each locality requires a corresponding GeoJSON file for locality-wide messages:
- Naming convention: `{locality}.geojson` (e.g., `bg.sofia.geojson`)
- Location: `ingest/localities/` directory
- Used by notification matching for locality-wide messages

## Adding a New Locality

1. **Add bounds and center** in `shared/src/bounds.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const BOUNDS: Record<string, BoundingBox> = {
     "bg.sofia": { /* existing */ },
     "bg.plovdiv": { north: 42.20, south: 42.10, east: 24.85, west: 24.70 },
   };
   
   export const CENTERS: Record<string, { lat: number; lng: number }> = {
     "bg.sofia": { /* existing */ },
     "bg.plovdiv": { lat: 42.1354, lng: 24.7453 },
   };
   ```

2. **Create GeoJSON file** at `ingest/localities/bg.plovdiv.geojson` containing the administrative boundary as a FeatureCollection

3. **Create crawlers** in `ingest/crawlers/` that set `locality: "bg.plovdiv"` when saving sources

4. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   LOCALITY=bg.plovdiv                    # Backend/Ingest
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCALITY=bg.plovdiv        # Frontend/Web
   ```

## Migration

Migration script: `migrate/2026-02-10-add-locality-field.ts`
- Backfills `locality: "bg.sofia"` to all existing records
- Safe to run multiple times (skips records that already have locality)
- Run with: `npx tsx migrate/2026-02-10-add-locality-field.ts`
