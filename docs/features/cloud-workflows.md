# Cloud Workflows Orchestration

This document describes how Google Cloud Workflows orchestrate the ingestion pipeline, providing granular task execution and improved observability.

## Overview

The ingestion pipeline uses **Google Cloud Workflows** to orchestrate crawler execution, data processing (ingest), and notifications. This replaces the previous monolithic approach where a single Cloud Run job performed all tasks sequentially.

### Key Benefits

- **Granular logging**: Each crawler, ingest, and notify task runs as a separate Cloud Run job execution with isolated logs
- **Better alerting**: Failures can be traced to specific tasks (e.g., "crawler toplo failed" vs "pipeline failed")
- **Parallel execution**: All crawlers run simultaneously, reducing total pipeline time
- **Visibility**: Workflow execution graph shows task dependencies and status in Cloud Console
- **Resilience**: Pipeline continues to ingest/notify even if some crawlers fail

## Architecture

```
Cloud Scheduler
    ↓
Google Cloud Workflows
    ↓
    ├─→ [Parallel] Crawler Jobs
    ↓   └─→ Firestore (sources collection)
    ├─→ [Sequential] Ingest Job
    ↓   └─→ Firestore (messages collection)
    └─→ [Sequential] Notify Job
        └─→ Firebase Cloud Messaging (push notifications)
```

### Two Workflow Types

1. **Emergent Workflow** (`pipeline-emergent`)
   - **Crawlers**: A subset of sources that publish short-lived disruptions (utility outages, emergency works)
  - **Schedule**: Every 30 minutes in the configured scheduler timezone
   - **Use case**: Short-lived disruptions requiring frequent updates

2. **All Workflow** (`pipeline-all`)
   - **Crawlers**: All currently deployed crawlers
  - **Schedule**: 3 times daily in the configured scheduler timezone
   - **Use case**: Long-term construction/repair projects and municipal announcements from district administrations

The scheduler timezone is configured through Terraform (`schedule_timezone`).

Example profile (Sofia deployment): emergent runs every 30 minutes between 7:00 and 22:30, and full runs at 10:00, 14:00, and 16:00.

## Workflow Execution Flow

### Step 1: Parallel Crawler Execution

All crawlers run simultaneously, each as a separate Cloud Run job. Each crawler fetches data from its respective external source (API or website) and writes raw documents to Firestore.

**Failure behavior**: Crawlers are wrapped in `try`/`except` blocks. If one fails, it logs an ERROR but doesn't stop other crawlers or the workflow.

### Step 2: Sequential Ingest

After all crawlers complete (success or failure), the `ingest-messages` job runs:

- Processes all unprocessed source documents in Firestore
- Performs AI categorization (for sources without precomputed GeoJSON)
- Geocodes addresses/streets using Google Maps, Overpass, and Cadastre APIs
- Creates messages with GeoJSON geometries
- Marks messages as `finalized`

**Failure behavior**: If ingest fails, workflow logs an ERROR and continues to notify step.

**Handled geocoding misses**: Not every message-level geocoding problem is a workflow failure. Messages that cannot produce valid geometry can still be finalized without GeoJSON and inspected later through `ingestErrors`. Temporary Overpass saturation is expected to surface mainly as warnings unless it aborts the job.

### Step 3: Sequential Notify

After ingest completes, the `send-notifications` job runs:

- Matches finalized messages to user notification preferences
- Sends push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Updates last notification timestamp for users

**Failure behavior**: If notify fails, workflow logs an ERROR and completes.

## Monitoring Workflow Executions

### Cloud Console

1. Navigate to **Workflows** in Google Cloud Console
2. Select workflow: `pipeline-emergent` or `pipeline-all`
3. Click **Executions** tab to see recent runs
4. Click on any execution to see:
   - Execution graph (visual representation of steps)
   - Step-by-step logging with timestamps
   - Input/output of each step
   - Error messages for failed steps

### Individual Task Logs

Each Cloud Run job execution has separate logs:

1. Navigate to **Cloud Run** → **Jobs**
2. Select the relevant job
3. Click **Logs** tab
4. Filter by execution time to find logs from specific workflow run

### Checking Scheduler Status

Cloud Scheduler triggers workflows on schedule:

```bash
# List all scheduled jobs
gcloud scheduler jobs list --location=europe-west1

# View specific schedule
gcloud scheduler jobs describe pipeline-emergent-schedule \
  --location=europe-west1
```

## Manual Workflow Execution

### Trigger Workflow Manually

Useful for testing or emergency re-runs:

```bash
# Execute emergent workflow
gcloud workflows execute pipeline-emergent --location=europe-west1

# Execute all workflow
gcloud workflows execute pipeline-all --location=europe-west1
```

The command returns an execution ID immediately. Use it to check status:

```bash
# Check execution status
gcloud workflows executions describe EXECUTION_ID \
  --workflow=pipeline-emergent \
  --location=europe-west1
```

### List Recent Executions

```bash
# View last 10 executions
gcloud workflows executions list \
  --workflow=pipeline-emergent \
  --location=europe-west1 \
  --limit=10
```

## Failure Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Crawler Fails

**Example**: One crawler fails due to a website timeout

**Behavior**:

- Workflow logs ERROR for the failed crawler
- Other crawlers continue running
- Ingest processes all successful crawler results
- Notify runs normally
- **Result**: Partial success - most sources updated, failed source data stale

**Investigation**:

1. Check workflow execution graph - the failed step will show error
2. View that crawler's Cloud Run job logs for detailed error
3. Check if the source website is accessible

### Scenario 2: All Crawlers Fail

**Example**: Firestore outage prevents all crawlers from writing

**Behavior**:

- All crawler steps log ERRORs
- Ingest runs but finds no new source documents to process
- Notify runs but has no new messages to send
- **Result**: No new data, but system remains operational

**Investigation**:

1. Check Firestore status in Cloud Console
2. Review multiple crawler logs to identify common failure pattern
3. Check service account permissions

### Scenario 3: Ingest Fails

**Example**: Google AI API quota exceeded during categorization

**Behavior**:

- Crawlers complete successfully, new source documents in Firestore
- Ingest step logs ERROR
- Notify runs but has no new finalized messages
- **Result**: Data collected but not processed

**Investigation**:

1. Check `ingest-messages` job logs for quota errors
2. Review Google AI API quota in GCP Console
3. Re-run workflow manually after quota resets

### Scenario 4: Notify Fails

**Example**: Firebase Cloud Messaging certificate expired

**Behavior**:

- Crawlers and ingest complete successfully
- Notify step logs ERROR
- **Result**: New messages available in app but users not notified

**Investigation**:

1. Check `send-notifications` job logs for FCM errors
2. Verify Firebase project configuration
3. Re-run workflow to retry notifications

## Emergency Fallback: Legacy Pipeline Jobs

If Workflows are completely unavailable (rare GCP service outage), use the legacy monolithic pipeline jobs:

```bash
# Run emergent pipeline (all-in-one job)
gcloud run jobs execute pipeline-emergent --region=europe-west1 --wait

# Run full pipeline (all-in-one job)
gcloud run jobs execute pipeline-all --region=europe-west1 --wait
```

**Note**: These jobs are marked DEPRECATED and are NOT scheduled. They perform the same work as workflows but in a single container execution with combined logging.

## Alerting

Cloud Monitoring alert policies trigger when:

- Workflow execution fails (any step logs severity >= ERROR)
- Cloud Run job execution fails
- Notifications sent to configured email address

Alert notifications include:

- Workflow/job name
- Execution ID
- Link to Cloud Console for investigation

## Workflow Source Files

Workflow definitions are version-controlled under `ingest/terraform/workflows/`. Changes require Terraform deployment:

```bash
cd ingest/terraform
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Adding New Crawlers

Adding a new crawler requires updating both the crawler implementation and the Terraform workflow definitions. See [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for detailed crawler development guidelines.
